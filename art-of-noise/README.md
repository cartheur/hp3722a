## The art of precision noise

The working concept of _precision_ noise.

Most systems, from simple servos to suspension bridges, are subject to random disturbances which must be accounted for in the design and, if possible, simulated at the prototype test phase. For the purpose of simulation it seems appropriate to use a randomly varying test signal--that is, low-frequency noise--rather than the traditional sine wave. In environmental testing, too, the real-life "shock environment" can often be reproduced accurately with a noise-simulated transducer. The desirability of noise as a test signal has been appreciated for many years, but general acceptance of the technique has been slow--principally owing to the lack of satisfactory generators and related test gear for low-frequency noise.

Characterizing noise

The power spectrum describes only the frequency content of the noise signal, but does not characterize its waveshape: This is specified by the probability density function (PDF), a statistical indication of the proportion of time spent b the signal at various amplitudes. The most commonly encountered pdf is the classical bell-shaped or Gaussian curve so familiar is statistics: This particular pdf characterizes most random phenomena--for example atmospheric climate changes--and a noise signal designed to simulate such phenomena must have a pdf which closely approximates the Gaussian curve.

The question of pdf is another problem area with conventional noise generators. How can 'Gaussianness' be specified and over what period of time must the signal be evaluated to be certain that its amplitude characteristics tend to be Gaussian? Are the signal properties observed in a given period representative of the next similar period? This suggests that a series of identical experiments involving truly random noise will yield different results each time. This _statistical variance_ can often be reduced to acceptable limits by increasing the observation--that is, averaging--time; it can never entirely be eliminated although we can be more certain that having not worked this problem in the first place.
